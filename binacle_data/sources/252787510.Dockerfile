# This Dockerfile will build an image that is configured  
# to use Fluentd to collect all Docker container log files  
# and then cause them to be ingested using the Google Cloud  
# Logging API. This configuration assumes that the host performning  
# the collection is a VM that has been created with a logging.write  
# scope and that the Logging API has been enabled for the project  
# in the Google Developer Console.
